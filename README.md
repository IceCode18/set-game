# Concentration and Set Game Project
This project is a fun and challenging game that involves two different card games played with a standard 52-card deck: Concentration and Set. It is built using the Swift language and Xcode integrated development environment. It follows the Model/View/Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and incorporates advanced features such as blocks, multiple threading, and persistence of data across program launches.

<h3>Concentration</h3>
Concentration Game tests your ability to remember and match images. The goal is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. The player can flip two cards at a time. If the cards match, they are removed from the board. If they don’t match, they are flipped back over. The game ends when all the cards are matched.

The player can choose from four themes: animals, sports, flags and emojis. Each theme has different card images and sounds.

The player can also adjust the difficulty level by choosing how many pairs of cards to play with: 6, 8 or 10.

The player’s score is based on how many flips they make and how fast they finish the game. The lower the score, the better.

<h3>Set</h3>
Set is a game where the player tries to find sets of three cards that have either all the same or all different attributes. The attributes are shape (diamonds, ovals or squiggles), color (red, green or purple), number (one, two or three) and shading (solid, striped or open).

The player can see 12 cards on the board at a time. If there is a set among them, the player can tap on them to select them. If they form a valid set, they are replaced by new cards from the deck. If they don’t form a valid set, they are deselected.

The game ends when there are no more sets in the deck or on the board.

The player’s score is based on how many sets they find and how fast they find them. The higher the score, the better.

<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
The primary learning goals of this project are:

* To learn the fundamentals of the Swift programming language and iOS app development
* To understand the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and how to apply it to iOS app development
* To learn how to use various SwiftUI features such as property wrappers, view modifiers, shapes, animations and gestures
* To learn how to use the UIKit to build user interfaces, including buttons, labels, and text fields.
* To apply Swift concepts such as enums, optionals, generics and protocols
* To understand how to use Auto Layout to create adaptive user interfaces that work on different screen sizes and orientations.
* To learn how to use gestures and animations to create engaging user experiences.
* To design a user interface that is responsive, adaptive and attractive
